# 🚀 Digital Expiry Tracker

### AI-Assisted Expiry Management for Food & Medicine

---

## 📌 What is Digital Expiry Tracker?

**Digital Expiry Tracker** is a smart web application that helps users track the expiry dates of **food and medicine items** using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** and automated reminders.

It prevents health risks caused by expired products and reduces unnecessary wastage by providing timely alerts and a centralized digital inventory.

> **Simply put:**  
> Scan → Track → Get reminded → Stay safe.

## ❌ The Problem

Expiry management today is mostly manual and inefficient:

- ⏳ People forget expiry dates
- 🗑️ Food and medicines get wasted
- ⚠️ Health risks due to expired consumption
- 📄 No centralized digital tracking
- 😕 Manual checking is time-consuming

---

## ✅ Our Solution

**Digital Expiry Tracker provides:**

1. 📷 **OCR-Based Scanning** – Extract expiry dates from images  
2. 📦 **Digital Inventory** – Manage all products in one place  
3. ⏰ **Automated Reminders** – Alerts before items expire  
4. 📊 **Expiry Dashboard** – Upcoming & expired item tracking  
5. 🔐 **Reliable Backend APIs** – Secure and validated data handling  

---

## 🧠 How OCR Works

1. User uploads product image  
2. Image is preprocessed (resize, grayscale)  
3. OCR engine extracts text  
4. Expiry date is detected using pattern matching  
5. Date is stored in database  

> OCR integration is designed to be **modular and scalable**.
